## Usage 🚀

### Installation ⚙️

1. Download the release ZIP file from the release page. To build it yourself, please refer
   to [Build It Yourself](#build-it-yourself-).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh

   # If Docker requires root permission
   sudo bash setup.sh
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter variables and parameters.
5. You're all set!

### Admin Panel 🛡

Access the admin panel at: `https://example.com/admin`

Default admin account:

```plaintext
username: admin
password: admin
```

Remember to change the password after the first login.

### Setting the Rate Limit 🕒

The rate limit is set in nginx.
Default setting allows 10 requests per minute.
You can modify the limit in
`docker/nginx/nginx.conf`.

### Changing the Default Port 🔌

By default, the web service runs on port 8887. To change it, edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Customizing the Dictionary 📚

Customize the dictionary by editing the `dictionary.txt` file **before** installation.

To refresh the dictionary,
run the setup script again.
Please note that by doing so, you will lose all existing data.

**Reserved Words:**
Avoid using the following reserved words:
`login`, `admin`, `logout`, `api`, `index`, `index.html`, `change_pass`. These will be removed during setup without
notice.

## Build It Yourself 🛠

### File Structure 🗄

#### Source Code 🧑‍💻

- **Frontend:** Built using Vite, located in the `web-frontend` folder.
- **Backend:** Built using Python FastAPI, located in the `python-backend` folder.

#### Docker 🐳

- `docker/web`: Contains built frontend files.
- `docker/backend`: Contains Python backend files.
- `docker/nginx`: Contains Nginx `default.conf`.

### Prerequisites ✅

1. Node.js >= 23.5.0
2. Python >= 3.13.1

### Building 🚧

#### Frontend 🌐

1. Navigate to the `web-frontend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. (Optional) Modify the code as you wish.
4. (Optional) Vite can be executed in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
6. Copy the `dist` folder to `docker/` and rename it to `web`.

#### Backend 👨‍🔧

The FastAPI documentation is in https://example.com/api/v1/docs.

The authentication token is there to bypass the cookie for easy developing, so you only need either cookie or
authentication token to access the locked part of API in the documentation.

The token is stored in the `docker/backend/.env` file.
If it's setup by `setup.sh`, there will also be a copy stored in
`token.txt`.

If you want to modify the backend, follow these steps. Otherwise, copy the `python-backend` folder to `docker/` and
rename it to `backend`.

1. Navigate to the `python-backend` folder.
2. (Optional, take venv for example) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. (Skip if not using a virtual environment) Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Modify the code as you wish.
6. Run the backend in development mode:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
7. After modifying the backend, copy the `python-backend` folder to `docker/` and rename it to `backend`.
